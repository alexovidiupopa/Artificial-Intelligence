Proposed Solution Description - MAMDANI model for the Washing Machine problem

It generally represents an estimation of COA (centroid of area) by using a sample of n points, namely (xi,i = (1,2,3,4,5..n)

The input parameters will be the texture and the capacity.
For an input of texture=0, meaning very soft, and capacity=0.5, meaning medium, the output will be "easy"

In this model, output variables belong to a fuzzy set. Therefore, result of evaluation is applied for the membership
function of the consequence.

The Madmani model consists of the rule evaluations, namely, evaluation of consequence.
